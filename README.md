a business data analysis system that combines employee data management, sales analysis, and sorting algorithms. Here's the logical connection between the files:

Project Structure:
It's a Gradle-based Java project (indicated by gradle-wrapper.properties) which manages dependencies including Apache POI for Excel handling and JFreeChart for visualization
Data Management Layer:
EmployeeSalaryStoring.java handles the employee salary data using a HashMap to store employee names and their corresponding salaries
It provides basic operations like adding, removing, and displaying employee salary information
Analysis Layer:
CompanyDataAnalyzer.java is the main analysis component that:
Integrates employee data from EmployeeSalaryStoring
Loads product sales data from Excel files using Apache POI
Contains functionality for analyzing both employee and sales data
Can generate visual representations using JFreeChart (bar charts)
Sorting Capabilities:
Both MergeSort.java and QuickSort.java implement a Sortable interface
These sorting algorithms could be used to:
Sort employee salaries for payroll analysis
Order product sales data by various metrics (total sales, units sold, etc.)
Provide sorted views of data for reporting purposes
The application's likely workflow:

Load employee salary data
Import product sales from Excel sheets
Apply sorting algorithms as needed for analysis
Generate analysis reports and visualizations
Present the processed data in meaningful ways for business insights
This structure suggests a data analysis tool focused on company performance metrics, combining both personnel and sales data with robust sorting capabilities.

Database Integration:
Add PostgreSQL or MongoDB integration to persist data
Create proper data models for employees and sales
Implement a repository layer for data access
REST API Layer:
Build REST endpoints using Spring Boot
Enable CRUD operations for employee and sales data
Add authentication and authorization
Enhanced Analytics Features:
Implement payroll calculations including tax deductions
Add sales forecasting using historical data
Create department-wise budget analysis
Generate automated monthly/quarterly reports
Advanced UI Components:
Develop a web interface using React or Angular
Add interactive dashboards with real-time updates
Include data export functionality to PDF/Excel
Create dynamic charts and graphs
Additional Business Logic:
Inventory management system
Customer relationship management (CRM) integration
Employee performance metrics
Time tracking and attendance system
Project management capabilities
Automation Features:
Scheduled report generation
Email notifications for important metrics
Automated data backup system
Batch processing for large datasets
Testing and Monitoring:
Unit tests for business logic
Integration tests for API endpoints
Performance monitoring tools
Logging system for debugging
Advanced Data Processing:
Add support for multiple file formats (CSV, JSON)
Implement data validation rules
Add bulk import/export capabilities
Create data archiving system
These additions would transform it into a full-fledged enterprise resource planning (ERP) system while building upon your existing foundation of employee and sales analysis.

This setup provides:

A containerized Java application
PostgreSQL database with persistent storage
Database schema for employees and sales
Docker Compose for orchestrating the services
The existing sorting algorithms (MergeSort and QuickSort) can be utilized within the service layer for data analysis and reporting features as you build out the rest of the system.

It sounds like you've got a sophisticated Java Gradle program for handling company sales and employee data! Let’s break it down into manageable steps:

### 1. Viewing the Output
To see the output of your Java Gradle program, you can run it from the command line:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Use the following command to run your program:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```
This command will compile and execute your Java classes. The output should be displayed in your terminal.

### 2. Interacting with Java Classes
If you need to interact with your classes and manipulate data:

1. **Instantiate objects**: Create objects from your classes to work with the data.
2. **Call methods**: Use the methods defined in your classes to perform operations or retrieve information.

Here is a quick example:
```java
SalesData salesData = new SalesData();
salesData.loadFromExcel("path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx");
Report report = salesData.generateReport();
System.out.println(report);
```
This example assumes you have appropriate methods in your classes like `loadFromExcel` and `generateReport`.

### 3. Requesting Reports
You can use libraries like [JasperReports](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-jasper) to create custom reports. Here’s a simple way to set it up:

1. Add JasperReports as a dependency in your `build.gradle`:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       implementation 'net.sf.jasperreports:jasperreports:6.20.0'
   }
   ```
2. Prepare your JRXML template for the report.
3. Compile and fill the reports using Java code.

### 4. Manipulating Data in Excel](https://www.exceldemy.com/learn-excel/data-analysis/)
For Excel manipulation, consider using Apache POI which is a robust library for handling Excel files in Java:](https://www.exceldemy.com/learn-excel/data-analysis/)

1. Add Apache POI to your `build.gradle`:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       implementation 'org.apache.poi:poi:5.2.3'
       implementation 'org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:5.2.3'
   }
   ```
2. Here is an example of reading data from Excel:
   ```java
   FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(new File("path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx"));
   Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(file);
   Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);
   Iterator<Row> rowIterator = sheet.iterator();
   ```
3. You’ll need to process the data as per your requirements.

By combining these steps, you can effectively manage and interact with your Java Gradle program, generate reports, and manipulate data from Excel!

Do you need more detailed code examples or guidance on any of these steps?
