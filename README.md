a business data analysis system that combines employee data management, sales analysis, and sorting algorithms. Here's the logical connection between the files:

Project Structure:
It's a Gradle-based Java project (indicated by gradle-wrapper.properties) which manages dependencies including Apache POI for Excel handling and JFreeChart for visualization
Data Management Layer:
EmployeeSalaryStoring.java handles the employee salary data using a HashMap to store employee names and their corresponding salaries
It provides basic operations like adding, removing, and displaying employee salary information
Analysis Layer:
CompanyDataAnalyzer.java is the main analysis component that:
Integrates employee data from EmployeeSalaryStoring
Loads product sales data from Excel files using Apache POI
Contains functionality for analyzing both employee and sales data
Can generate visual representations using JFreeChart (bar charts)
Sorting Capabilities:
Both MergeSort.java and QuickSort.java implement a Sortable interface
These sorting algorithms could be used to:
Sort employee salaries for payroll analysis
Order product sales data by various metrics (total sales, units sold, etc.)
Provide sorted views of data for reporting purposes
The application's likely workflow:

Load employee salary data
Import product sales from Excel sheets
Apply sorting algorithms as needed for analysis
Generate analysis reports and visualizations
Present the processed data in meaningful ways for business insights
This structure suggests a data analysis tool focused on company performance metrics, combining both personnel and sales data with robust sorting capabilities.
